# asset-insights-techtest

Welcome to my tech test. I originally tried to solve this tech test by creating a database on Elephant SQL which uses Postgesql to write it's data. Using react I wanted to get the data and store it in a useState, however I tried for ages to figure out why my data was not showing, and I spent way to long trying to find the bug, to the point where I decided to try a different route to complete this tech test.

I wanted to try and use MongoDB as this is a database technology I want to learn, and after doing some more research, I decided to use some online resources about ejs and how to use it. I really wanted to build this in react however I just could not get the data from the api I had created so this was the route I took.

I have sent you the email with the config.env details and I will write the instructions on how to view the CRUD application below:

// Open the terminal first
-- type and run into the terminal: npm i
-- do this before any other step

// How to run the app

-- Open a terminal in the code editor of your choice and make sure you are in the crudApp directory 
-- In the terminal type the command: npm start 
-- Next type: localhost:3000, into your browser search bar



Following these steps you should now see the application in your internet browser.

Two Bugs:

1: After adding a user, it does add the data to the database however, it does not take you back to the main page, I am still trying to figure out the bug 
2: Selecting the seccond radio feild I had to remove from the app as it was not allowing the use to select this field.
